- Can't use jsx in js files. Files with jsx should have .jsx extension
  - Work arounds are not recommended according to vite maintainer https://github.com/vitejs/vite/discussions/3112#discussioncomment-650971
- CSS getting bundled as separate file
  - Used vite-plugin-css-injected-by-js to inject CSS to JS file
- All static files getting inlined in the JS bundle regardless of size when using build.lib
  - "Assets will always be inlined, regardless of file size, and build.assetsInlineLimit will be ignored if you specify build.lib"
- Build generating js files with just imports or chunks that are empty
  - https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/3358
  - preserveEntrySignatures: 'allow-extension'
- Separate chunks created for shared modules when using multiple input files
  - https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/2756
- CSS of the entire build regardless of the entry point is compiled in to a single file (injected using plugin to js files)
